# ASA_IST
Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms projects
## Projects:
- project 1 focuses on dynamic programming, specifically emphasizing the application of the [0/1 knapsack algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).
- project 2 is all about [Graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) and using some of the most well-known algorithms in that area.
- project 3 involves applying linear programming techniques using the [PuLP](https://pypi.org/project/PuLP/) library.
